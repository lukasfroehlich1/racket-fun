some puzzles solved using racket

The cannibal problem comes from [how to design programs](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/part_six.html) part 6 excercise 495.

the tictactoe problem is incomplete and still needs minimax to be implemented properly. All of the possible boards are generated and winning boards are marked.
